<h1 align= "center"> Facial Recognition Project (Ongoing) </h1>
A Computer Vision project centered around four tasks - 

  * Face Alignment.
  * Face Detection (bounding boxes).
  * Detecting Facial Keypoints.
  * Facial Recognition.
  
This project builds on what I learnt through the lectures and programming assignments of the [Deep Learning in Computer Vision](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-in-computer-vision) course on Coursera by National Research University School of Economics.
