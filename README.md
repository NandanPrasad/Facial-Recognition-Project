<h1 align= "center"> Facial Recognition Project </h1>
A Computer Vision project centered around four tasks - 

  * Face Alignment.
  * Face Detection (bounding boxes).
  * Detecting Facial Keypoints.
  * Facial Recognition.
  
This project was inspired by the lectures and programming assignments in the [Deep Learning in Computer Vision course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-in-computer-vision) on Coursera by National Research University School of Economics.
