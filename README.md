<h1 align= "center"> Facial Recognition Project (Ongoing) </h1>


---


This project builds on what I learnt through the lectures and programming assignments of the [Deep Learning in Computer Vision](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-in-computer-vision) course on Coursera by National Research University School of Economics.

This is Computer Vision project centered around four sequential tasks - 

  1. Face Alignment.
  2. Face Detection (bounding boxes).
  3. Detecting Facial Keypoints.
  4. Facial Recognition.
